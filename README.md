# Linux Kernel Module (LKM) Sandbox
## Overview
The Linux Kernel Module Sandbox is a little module to learn, test and experiment with
the development of Kernel Modules for the Linux System. It won't be anything very usable
and there won't be any new driver emerging from this sandbox (at least it is not intented).
That module is only for learning and study purpose and will contain also heavy comments
explaning things in the source code.

## Notes
"A Linux kernel module is a piece of compiled binary code that is inserted directly into 
the Linux kernel, running at ring 0, the lowest and least protected ring of execution in 
the x86–64 processor."

"Traditional application development paradigms can be largely discarded. Other than loading 
and unloading of your module, you’ll be writing code that responds to system events rather 
than operates in a sequential pattern."

*"With kernel development, you’re writing APIs, not applications themselves."*
